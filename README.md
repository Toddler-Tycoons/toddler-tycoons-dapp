### What does it offers

Toddler Tycoons is an NFT project where the money accumulated by minting is first stored in the treasury and then the treasury invests the sum into stable DeFi Protocols. The NFT holders are rewarded by distributing the returns on the investments made by the treasury. Apart from the minting revenue, the treasury is also funded by the royalties from each consecutive trade of the NFTs, which is again invested in the DeFi Protocols.

All the NFTs will be backed by the amount in the treasury and will have a definitive floor price. The NFT holders can return these NFTs if they want to withdraw from the community. When returning an NFT the Treasury will pay back the NFT holder the floor price at that point in time. All the NFTs collected by the treasury (acquired, returned, etc.) will be auctioned.
